### Better to check before actually executation. 
The current codes are:
```
uint credit = getCreditLimitInternal(borrower);
debts[borrower] += amount;
require(credit >= debts[borrower], "Exceeded credit limit");
```

We'd better to check this before actually executation. It will be save the gas if we do like this:
```
uint credit = getCreditLimitInternal(borrower);
require(credit >= debts[borrower] + amount, "Exceeded credit limit");
debts[borrower] += amount;
```
